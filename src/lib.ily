% Precondition: Factors is a possibly empty sorted (in descending order) list of pairs (x . y)
% Postconditions: The returned list is a sorted list of pairs (x . y) satisfying the following conditions:
%	- Each pair has a unique left hand element (key)
%	- Adjacent pairs (x . y) and (x . z) in the input list are combined into (x . (+ y z))
%	- Adjacent pairs (3 . y) and (5 . z) in the input list are combined into
%		((* 5 prime) . z)
%	  where prime is some prime number, see `accidentals.ily` for an explanation
%	- No pair has 2 as its key
